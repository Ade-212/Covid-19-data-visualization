# Covid-19-data-visualization
Repository that holds a data visualization project i completed during my computing segment of my joint degree that i created using worldwide datasets related to Covid-19

# Project description:
This project takes a visual approach to comprehend the global impact of COVID-19 over a two year period, from 2020 to 2022 Through interactive visualizations created using Jupyter notebooks, users can interactively explore the progression of the pandemic across different countries and regions.

Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly for creating an insightful visuak representations of the pandemics spread

Challenges & Future features: A challenge was processing and visualizing large datasets. In the future i plan to involve incorporating more geographical data and enable users to customize the visualizations.
